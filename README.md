# Here-Today



A website that collects weather data based on the website visitor's location to generate algorithmic music compositions along with a reading of the temperature and a short description of the weather. The goal of this page is to provide a minimal "weather channel" experience and to make the user consider the specific qualities of the place they inhabit. Through the generated music, the aim is for the visitor to think about how the cloud coverage, air pressure, temperature, and other meteorological minutiae are changing what they are listening to.

The earliest ideas for this project were influenced by the music of [Temple OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmjU-6tkEc8&ab_channel=ZAMORA), an operating system designed by Terry A. Davis. 

The website can currently be visited [here](sailorlivingston.github.io).

This project was made for Nick Briz's Artware Professional Practice class at SAIC, and the first iterations were made on [netnet.studio](https://netnet.studio/).
